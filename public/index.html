    <h1>Front-end Development is the Worst</h1>
    <p>
      Look, front-end development is for script kindles and soydevs who can't handle real programming. I mean, it's bunch of div and span, right? And css??? It's like, "Oh, I want this to be red, but not thaaat red." What a joke.

      Real programmers code, not silly markup languages. They code on Arch Linux, not macOS, and certainly not Windows. They use Vim, not VS Code. They use C, not HTML. Come to the <<a href="https://www.boot.dev">backend</a>, where the real programming happens.
